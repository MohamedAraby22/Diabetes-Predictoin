## Diabetes Prediction Project using SQL

This project utilizes SQL queries to explore and analyze data related to diabetes prediction. The provided SQL script addresses various aspects of patient information, potentially serving as a foundation for further data analysis and machine learning modeling.

**Key Questions Addressed:**

1. **Retrieving Basic Patient Information:** How can we retrieve the Patient IDs and ages of all patients in the dataset?

2. **Identifying Specific Demographics:** How can we select female patients who are older than 30 years old?

3. **Calculating Average Health Indicators:** How can we calculate the average Body Mass Index (BMI) for all patients?

4. **Analyzing Blood Glucose Levels:** How can we order patient data based on their blood glucose levels, showing the highest levels first?

5. **Identifying Patients with Comorbidities:** How can we find patients diagnosed with both hypertension and diabetes?

6. **Determining Disease Prevalence:** How can we count the total number of patients recorded with heart disease?

7. **Smoking and Diabetes Risk:** How can we group patients by their smoking history and analyze the number of smokers and non-smokers?

8. **High BMI and Potential Risk:** How can we retrieve the IDs of patients whose BMI is greater than the overall average BMI?

9. **HbA1c Levels and Risk Assessment:** How can we identify the patient with the highest HbA1c level (indicating poor blood sugar control) and the patient with the lowest HbA1c level?

 10. Age Calculation:**  How can we calculate the patients' current age in years (assuming a specific date can be incorporated into the query)?

11. **Blood Glucose Distribution within Gender:** How can we rank patients within each gender group based on their blood glucose levels?

12. **Simulating Data Updates:** How can we update the smoking history of patients who are older than 40 years old to "Ex-smoker" (demonstrates data manipulation)?

13. **Adding New Patient Data:** How can we insert a new patient record with sample data into the database (demonstrates data insertion)?

14. **Identifying Specific Patient Subsets:** How can we find patients who have hypertension but not diabetes using the EXCEPT operator (demonstrates advanced query techniques)?

15. **Ensuring Data Integrity:** How can we define a unique constraint on the "patient_id" column to ensure each patient has a distinct identifier?

16. **Creating Customized Views:** How can we create a view that displays a subset of patient information, such as Patient ID, Age, and BMI?

17. **Exploring Data Relationships:** How can we create a view that combines data from multiple tables to reveal insights into patient characteristics and diagnoses (demonstrates advanced query capabilities)?
